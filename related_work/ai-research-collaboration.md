## Analysis Framework

For each paper found, analyze:

### 1. Problem Identification
- What specific research collaboration problem is being addressed?
- Why is this problem important for the research community?

### 2. Assumption Analysis
- What assumptions about research collaboration does prior work make?
- Are these assumptions explicit or implicit in the literature?

### 3. Technical Innovation
- How does the proposed solution challenge existing assumptions?
- What novel technical approaches are introduced?

### 4. Evaluation Methodology
- How is the effectiveness of the collaboration tool measured?
- What standards of evidence are applied?

### 5. Field Impact
- How might this work change research collaboration practices?
- What broader implications exist for AI-assisted research?

## Research Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: Assumption Discovery Tools
- **Current State**: Tools help find and organize papers
- **Missing**: Tools that help identify assumptions spanning multiple papers
- **Opportunity**: AI that can surface implicit assumptions for researcher consideration

### Gap 2: Hypothesis Generation from Literature
- **Current State**: Literature review leads to incremental research questions  
- **Missing**: Systematic approaches to flip literature-level assumptions
- **Opportunity**: AI co-scientist that suggests novel research directions through assumption inversion

### Gap 3: Collaborative Assumption Testing
- **Current State**: Individual researchers test isolated hypotheses
- **Missing**: Platforms for coordinated assumption validation across research teams
- **Opportunity**: Multi-researcher assumption testing and validation platforms

## Oslo Platform Implications

Based on identified gaps, Oslo should prioritize:

1. **Literature-Level Assumption Discovery**: Tools to identify patterns in assumptions across papers
2. **Collaborative Hypothesis Generation**: Multi-researcher assumption flipping and testing
3. **Integrated Research Pipeline**: Seamless connection between assumption discovery and experiment design

## Notes for Paper Collection

When collecting papers for analysis:
- Focus on venues that publish collaboration and AI research tools
- Prioritize papers that explicitly challenge existing assumptions
- Look for evaluation studies that measure research impact, not just user satisfaction
- Seek papers that propose novel evaluation metrics for research assistance tools

## Connection to Main Research

This analysis directly supports the core research question: **How can AI research collaboration tools be designed to optimize collective knowledge synthesis rather than individual productivity?**
