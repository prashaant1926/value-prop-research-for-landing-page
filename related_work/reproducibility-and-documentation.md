# Research Reproducibility & Documentation Tools

## Research Focus
Analysis of research reproducibility tools, experiment tracking systems, and research documentation platforms, with focus on identifying assumptions about what makes research reproducible.

## Key Assumption Categories

### C1: Documentation-Centric Assumption
**Current Assumption**: Reproducibility requires detailed manual documentation of experimental procedures
**Evidence**: Most tools focus on capturing experimental parameters, data processing steps, and methodological details

**Potential Flip**: Reproducibility requires **assumption tracking** - explicitly documenting which theoretical assumptions were tested and validated

### C2: Linear Workflow Assumption  
**Current Assumption**: Research workflows are linear and predictable sequences of steps
**Evidence**: Tools designed around pipeline concepts, step-by-step documentation, and sequential execution models

**Potential Flip**: Research workflows are **assumption exploration processes** that branch based on which assumptions prove valid or invalid

### C3: Separation of Concerns Assumption
**Current Assumption**: Experiment tracking should be separate from hypothesis generation and theoretical development
**Evidence**: Distinct tools for experiment management vs. literature review vs. hypothesis development

**Potential Flip**: **Integrated assumption-experiment workflows** where hypothesis generation, experiment design, and results interpretation are unified around assumption testing

### Specific Paper Types to Find

#### 1. Experiment Tracking & Reproducibility

**Analysis Focus**: What aspects of experiments do these assume are most important to track?

#### 2. Research Documentation Systems
- Laboratory notebook digitization and automation
- Structured documentation standards for research
- Knowledge management systems for research teams

**Analysis Focus**: How do these define "complete documentation" and what assumptions underlie this definition?

#### 3. Workflow Management for Research
- Scientific workflow engines (Galaxy, Nextflow, etc.)
- Research pipeline automation tools
- Integration platforms for research tool ecosystems

**Analysis Focus**: What assumptions about research processes are embedded in these workflow models?

## Research Questions for Each Paper

### 1. Reproducibility Philosophy Analysis
- How does the paper define "reproducible research"?
- What aspects of the research process does it assume are most critical to reproduce?

### 2. Workflow Model Analysis
- Does the solution assume research follows predictable, linear workflows?
- How does it handle the iterative, exploratory nature of research?

### 3. Theory-Practice Integration
- How does the tool connect theoretical development (hypotheses) with practical execution (experiments)?
- Does it treat these as separate concerns or integrated processes?

### 4. Assumption Tracking Potential
- Could this tool be extended to explicitly track theoretical assumptions being tested?
- Does it have mechanisms for documenting assumption validation or invalidation?

## Research Synthesis Framework

### Cross-Paper Pattern Analysis

#### Technical Patterns to Track
1. **Process Documentation**: Papers focusing on capturing what was done
2. **Data Provenance**: Papers focusing on tracking data transformations and lineage  
3. **Method Standardization**: Papers focusing on standardizing experimental procedures
4. **Integrated Workflows**: Papers attempting end-to-end research process support

#### Assumption Patterns to Track
1. **Completeness Assumptions**: More detailed documentation leads to better reproducibility
2. **Mechanistic Assumptions**: Reproducibility is primarily about repeating the same steps
3. **Individual Assumptions**: Reproducibility is about enabling other researchers to replicate individual studies

### Gap Identification Process

For each major assumption category (C1-C3):
1. **Current Limitation**: How do existing tools embody this assumption and what problems does this create?
2. **Flip Potential**: What would research reproducibility look like if we inverted this assumption?
3. **Technical Innovation**: What new capabilities would be needed for assumption-centric reproducibility?
4. **Impact Assessment**: How would this change reproducibility practices across research fields?

## Oslo Platform Design Implications

### Core Design Principle
**Instead of optimizing reproducibility for methodological completeness, optimize for assumption transparency and validation**

### Specific Features Suggested
1. **Assumption-Experiment Linking**: Direct connections between theoretical assumptions and experimental tests
2. **Assumption Validation Tracking**: Systems to track which assumptions have been supported/refuted across experiments
3. **Collaborative Assumption Testing**: Multi-researcher coordination around testing shared theoretical assumptions
4. **Cumulative Assumption Knowledge**: Community-wide tracking of assumption validation status across research fields

## Literature Collection Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Papers (4-5 papers)
- Seminal papers in research reproducibility and open science
- Papers that explicitly discuss assumptions about what makes research reproducible
- High-impact reviews of reproducibility challenges across fields

### Phase 2: Technical Systems (8-10 papers)
- Papers on experiment tracking and research workflow systems
- Documentation and knowledge management tools for research
- Integration platforms that connect multiple aspects of research process

### Phase 3: Methodology & Philosophy (6-8 papers)
- Papers that challenge existing reproducibility paradigms
- Studies evaluating the effectiveness of different reproducibility approaches
- Philosophical papers on the nature of reproducible research

## Connection to Research Methodology

This literature analysis directly supports the research methodology from CLAUDE.md:
1. **Identify assumptions** about what makes research reproducible and how to achieve it
2. **Propose flips** that shift focus from process documentation to assumption validation
3. **Validate impact** by showing how assumption-centric reproducibility could transform research practices

## Research Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: Assumption-Centric Documentation
- **Current State**: Tools document experimental procedures and parameters
- **Missing**: Tools that explicitly document which theoretical assumptions are being tested
- **Opportunity**: Research documentation that centers on assumption validation rather than method replication

### Gap 2: Integrated Theory-Experiment Workflows
- **Current State**: Separate tools for hypothesis development and experiment execution
- **Missing**: Integrated workflows where experiments are designed explicitly to test theoretical assumptions
- **Opportunity**: Platforms that unify assumption tracking, experiment design, and result interpretation

### Gap 3: Community Assumption Validation
- **Current State**: Reproducibility focused on individual study replication
- **Missing**: Community-wide tracking of assumption validation status across studies
- **Opportunity**: Collective knowledge systems that track which assumptions have been validated across research communities

## Notes for Paper Collection

When collecting papers for analysis:
- Focus on papers that explicitly discuss philosophy of reproducibility, not just technical solutions
- Look for papers that attempt to integrate multiple aspects of research workflows
- Prioritize studies that evaluate reproducibility approaches empirically
- Seek papers that discuss challenges and limitations of current reproducibility paradigms

## Connection to Main Research

This analysis supports the core research question: **How can research reproducibility tools be designed to optimize assumption validation rather than just methodological replication?**

This connects directly to Oslo's potential as an AI co-scientist that helps researchers track and validate the theoretical assumptions underlying their experimental work.
