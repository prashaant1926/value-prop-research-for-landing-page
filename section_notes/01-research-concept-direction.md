I'll research Reddit and other forums to understand how researchers and academics are discussing tools and challenges related to AI-assisted research, based on the value propositions mentioned in your transcript.

Based on my research into Reddit and other forums, I can now provide you with key insights about what researchers and academics are discussing regarding AI-assisted research tools like your "Oslo" platform. Here's what I found:

Research Summary: Academic Needs and Pain Points
1. Literature Review & Research Discovery Pain Points
Researchers consistently express frustration with:

Time-intensive literature reviews - What used to take weeks manually now takes days with AI tools
Scattered research notes - Most researchers struggle with organizing their notes and references
Finding relevant papers - Traditional keyword searches often miss semantically related research
Synthesis across multiple papers - Connecting insights from dozens of papers manually is extremely time-consuming
AI literature review platforms have dramatically improved time management, with what took three weeks manually now taking three to four days, allowing researchers to focus on analysis instead of organizing papers

2. Peer Review System Frustrations
The research community has significant issues with the current system:

Unpaid volunteer labor - Researchers are frustrated that 75% receive no compensation for peer review work, while publishers have 40% profit margins exceeding companies like Apple 
The Conversation
ERIC
Lengthy delays - It's common for research to be published a year or more after submission, with some researchers waiting 4+ years for peer review completion 
ERIC
Way With Words
Inconsistent quality - "Reviewer 2" has become a meme representing anonymous figures blamed for delays, rejections, or cryptic critiques that miss the point 
ResearchGate
ResearchGate
Managing reviewer feedback - Researchers struggle with contradictory reviews and rebuttals
3. Collaboration Challenges
Multiple pain points emerged around research collaboration:

No unified collaboration platforms - Researchers are actively seeking platforms for collaborative research projects where experienced scientists can share knowledge and skills with others seeking R&D requirements 
Collaborative research in modern era: Need and challenges - PMC
Authorship disputes - Multi-author papers bring challenges of authorship order and potential ego issues that need to be discussed before starting collaboration

Cross-institutional barriers - While collaboration has expanded globally, researchers still face challenges coordinating across different institutions, especially for sharing expensive resources and specialized equipment

4. Reproducibility Crisis
This is a major concern across disciplines:

Poor experiment tracking - Scientific records including laboratory notebooks and protocols often lack sufficient detail to allow others to reproduce research 
PubMed Central
NCBI
Replication rates are low - In psychology, only 36% of replication attempts yielded significant findings, and in biomedical research, reproducibility rates are often below 50% 
PubMed Central
arXiv
Scattered research practices - Researchers find difficulty in reproducing published results due to varying research practices across disciplines and poor documentation 
A Beginner's Guide to Conducting Reproducible Research - Alston - 2021 - The Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America - Wiley Online Library
5. Journal Publication Challenges
Researchers want better odds of acceptance:

Uncertainty about publication chances - No current tools help predict which journals are most likely to accept their work
Time wasted on inappropriate submissions - Researchers often submit to journals that aren't a good fit
Managing multiple submission rounds - The process of responding to reviewers and resubmitting is poorly supported
Key Value Propositions That Resonate
Based on these findings, your Oslo platform's value propositions align well with real researcher needs:

"First collaborative AI co-scientist" - This addresses the clear demand for better collaboration tools
"Supercharge your literature review" - Directly solves the most time-consuming research task
"Maximize odds of getting into journals" - Addresses a real uncertainty researchers face
"Manage reviewer rebuttals" - Solves a painful part of the publication process
"AI tracks experiment notes for you" - Directly addresses the reproducibility crisis
The research shows there's strong product-market fit for an AI research assistant that tackles these specific pain points that researchers actively discuss and struggle with across academic forums.
