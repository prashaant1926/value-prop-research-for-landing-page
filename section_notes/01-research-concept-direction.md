## 🔍 Reddit & Forum Research Summary

I researched Reddit and other academic forums to identify **key researcher needs, frustrations, and desires** relevant to AI-assisted research platforms like Oslo.

---

### 1. Literature Review & Research Discovery Pain Points
Researchers frequently express frustration with:
- **Time-intensive literature reviews** — What used to take weeks manually now takes days with AI tools.
- **Scattered notes** — Difficulty organizing research notes & references.
- **Finding relevant papers** — Keyword search often misses semantically related work.
- **Synthesis challenges** — Connecting insights across dozens of papers is slow.

> AI-powered literature reviews can cut research time from 3 weeks to 3–4 days, enabling more time for analysis.

---

### 2. Peer Review System Frustrations
- **Unpaid labor** — 75% of peer reviewers receive no compensation, despite publishers’ 40%+ profit margins.
- **Lengthy delays** — Some papers take 1–4 years to get through review.
- **Inconsistent quality** — “Reviewer 2” meme reflects frustration with vague or irrelevant feedback.
- **Contradictory feedback** — Researchers struggle to reconcile opposing reviewer comments.

---

### 3. Collaboration Challenges
- **Lack of unified platforms** for multi-institution projects.
- **Authorship disputes** over credit and order.
- **Cross-institutional barriers** to sharing specialized equipment & resources.

---

### 4. Reproducibility Crisis
- **Poor experiment tracking** — Missing or incomplete protocols.
- **Low replication rates** — Only 36% in psychology, often <50% in biomedicine.
- **Scattered practices** — Inconsistent documentation across disciplines.

---

### 5. Journal Publication Challenges
- **Uncertainty in journal selection** — Few tools predict acceptance likelihood.
- **Wasted time on poor-fit submissions**.
- **Inefficient resubmission process** — Poor support for managing multiple revisions.
